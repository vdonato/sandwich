    ### Some useful things to know about Ethereum (and blockchains in general):

      * Transactions
        * Transactions are batched into blocks.
        * Transactions in the same block happen atomically.
        * ***BUT***, transaction ordering *within* a block may matter.
        * Pending transactions are sent to every node in the network, and while
          they are waiting for a miner to include them in a block, they're said
          to live in the "Mempool". Pending transactions are visible to all.
      * Gas
        * Gas is the fee that you pay so that a miner picks up and processes
          your transaction.
        * If you want your transaction to be processed earlier, you can pay
          more gas.
      * Market impact
        * In any market, buying or selling a LOT of an asset will affect the
          price and will push it up or down.
        * Example: look at what happened to TSLA after Elon sold a few billion
          dollars worth of it
      * DEXs: "Decentralized Exchanges"
        * Not operated by a centralized party (like Coinbase).
        * Instead, runs via smart contracts on a blockchain (like the Ethereum
          network).

    ### What is a 游볽 attack?

    Essentially, it's a form of frontrunning, but it has some properties unique
    to the blockchain.

    Let's look at an example

      1. Mr. Whale put a few thousand dollars into Bitcoin in 2010, and now he
         has more money than he knows what to do with. His next play is to buy
         a bunch of this funny dog coin SHIB that everyone is talking about.
      2. He goes to Uniswap, a popular DEX, to buy some SHIB for USDT
         (technically USDT).
      3. Se침or Shark is keeping an eye on the mempool and sees a Uniswap
         transaction buying $1MM worth of SHIB. The transaction is offering 100
         gas to the miner in exchange for processing it. He then

         * Submits a buy for $100k worth of SHIB at a gas price of 101.
         * Simultaneously, he submits a sell for all of the SHIB he's about to
           buy.
      4. The miner then processes the transactions in this relative order:

         * Se침or Shark's buy for $100k worth of SHIB
         * Mr. Whale's buy for $1MM worth of SHIB
         * Se침or Shark's sell order for all of his SHIB
      5. Mr. Whale is sad because he got a worse average price that he would
         have gotten if Se침or Shark hadn't made the sandwich attack.
